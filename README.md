Involve: its a social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their 
lives, here i used mongodb, Express, React and node. 
It's a full fledged CRUD application. CRUD stands for create read update and delete.

here since i was working with two different applications i made two folders, first one is going to 
be for our CLIENT side application or React side, then the second one is going to be for the NODE


dependencies installed are 
on the server side i installed body-parser which enables me to send post requests

express: used as a framework to create the routing application


cors: this enables cross origin requests 

mongoose: to create modules for our posts 

nodemon: so that i dont have to manually restart the server everytime i make a change


on the client side i installed 

axios: for making Api requests 
 
moment: moment.js is a library for working with time and date

react-file-base-64: for converting my images  

redux redux-thunk: used for asynchronous actions using redux


on the client side, src folder: we create an index.js file which we'll use to connect our react 
application to our index.html file  


then i'm going to use mongoose to connect to our database




200 means the request has succeeded



ma thoughts are introverted by my staying up all night to work on these softwares especially with 
rap music on the side seriously, programming aint just interesting, it's the holy grail, 
nappy hair, gap in her smile.
as a software developer you aren't just battling with codes, you're battling with yourself 
the object in this whole bunch of software is to process and digest the coding dialect and ethics
